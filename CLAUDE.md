# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Lean 4 formalization project for **Binomial Edge Ideals (BEI)**, based on Herzog et al. (2010). The goal is to formally verify results about binomial edge ideals of simple graphs in commutative algebra.

- **Lean version**: `leanprover/lean4:v4.28.0`
- **Primary dependency**: Mathlib `v4.28.0`
- **Build system**: Lake (Lean's package manager)

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the entire project
lake build

# Build a specific file (e.g., BEI.Definitions)
lake build BEI.Definitions

# Update/fetch dependencies
lake update

# Clean build artifacts
lake clean
```

There is no test suite — correctness is enforced by Lean's type checker. A successful `lake build` with no errors is required, and reducing the remaining `sorry`s is the current mathematical goal.

## Project Structure

- `BEI/Definitions.lean` — Core mathematical definitions: `BinomialEdgeVars V` (= `V ⊕ V`), notation `x i` and `y i` for the two copies of variables, `binomialEdgeIdeal G`, and `IsClosedGraph G` (Condition (b) of Theorem 1.1 in Herzog et al.)
- `BEI/Groebner.lean` — Term order: defines `binomialEdgeLE` (lex with `x_1 > x_2 > ... > x_n > y_1 > ... > y_n`) and the corresponding `LinearOrder (BinomialEdgeVars V)` instance
- `BEI/MonomialOrder.lean` — Connects the linear order to Mathlib's `MonomialOrder` infrastructure; proves leading term of `f_{ij}` is `x_i · y_j`
- `BEI/GraphProperties.lean` — `IsChordal`, `IsClawFree`, `graphClosure`; Propositions 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, Corollary 1.3
- `BEI/AdmissiblePaths.lean` — `pathMonomial`, `groebnerElement`, `groebnerBasisSet`; admissible path membership
- `BEI/GroebnerAPI.lean` — `IsRemainder`, `IsGroebnerBasis`, Buchberger's criterion (fully proved)
- `BEI/ClosedGraphs.lean` — **Theorem 1.1**: closed graph ↔ quadratic Gröbner basis (fully proved)
- `BEI/GroebnerBasisSPolynomial.lean` — Buchberger / S-polynomial proof of Theorem 2.1
- `BEI/GroebnerBasis.lean` — reducedness half of Theorem 2.1 and the paper-facing wrapper theorem
- `BEI/Radical.lean` — Corollary 2.2 (`J_G` is radical)
- `BEI/PrimeIdeals.lean` — `primeComponent`, `componentCount`; Section 3 prime ideal properties
- `BEI/MinimalPrimes.lean` — Proposition 3.8, Corollary 3.9; minimal prime characterization
- `BEI/PrimeDecomposition.lean` — Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 3.6
- `BEI/PrimeDecompositionDimension.lean` — Corollaries 3.3 and 3.4, `corollary_3_7_CM`, plus quotient-dimension / CM support lemmas
- `BEI/CIIdeals.lean` — Section 4: `CIStatement`, `ciGraph`, `ciIdeal`, `ciGraphSpec`, `ciIdealSpec`, the single-statement and specification bridge theorems, and transferred radicality / prime decomposition / minimal-prime theorems
- `BEI/CohenMacaulay.lean` — CM-dependent paper results (currently over a local working CM definition)
- `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Defs.lean` — local backport / working definition for the CM branch
- `toMathlib/MonomialIdeal.lean` — monomial ideals in `MvPolynomial`, variable-generated prime ideals, the prime classification for monomial ideals, and the forward primary monomial criterion
- `BEI.lean` — Root library entry point
- `BEI.tex` — Reference paper with the mathematical content being formalized
- `TODO.md` / `FORMALIZATION_MAP.md` — human-facing status docs that must be updated whenever theorem status or file layout changes
- `guides/` — self-contained agent guides for the active formalization branches
- `questions/` — incoming worker questions; preserve question context in any answer guide before deleting the question file

## Key Mathematical Concepts

- **Variables**: The polynomial ring uses `V ⊕ V` as the index type; `Sum.inl i` represents `x_i` and `Sum.inr i` represents `y_i`.
- **Binomial edge ideal**: `J_G = ⟨x_i y_j - x_j y_i : {i,j} ∈ E(G), i < j⟩` as a `Ideal (MvPolynomial (BinomialEdgeVars V) K)`.
- **Closed graph**: The `IsClosedGraph` property encodes that for any edges sharing a vertex, certain additional edges must exist (the condition that characterizes when `J_G` has a quadratic Gröbner basis).
- **Term order**: The Gröbner order is `x_1 > x_2 > … > x_n > y_1 > y_2 > … > y_n` (all `x`-variables above all `y`-variables, smaller index = larger variable), matching the paper.

## Lean/Mathlib Conventions

- The project uses `noncomputable section` throughout (polynomials over fields are noncomputable).
- `relaxedAutoImplicit = false` is set — all variables must be explicitly declared or introduced with `variable`.
- Linter `weak.linter.mathlibStandardSet` is enabled; follow Mathlib style for naming and formatting.
- Use `open MvPolynomial` when working with multivariate polynomials (already opened in `Definitions.lean`).
- Relevant Mathlib namespaces: `MvPolynomial`, `Ideal`, `SimpleGraph`, `LinearOrder`.

## Status-Tracking Rule

- Treat `BEI.tex` and the Lean files as the source of truth.
- If a theorem is finished, moved, split across files, or downgraded from an earlier claim, update `TODO.md` and `FORMALIZATION_MAP.md` in the same round.
- `IsCohenMacaulay` now has a real local working definition (equidimensionality) in `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Defs.lean`. The Section 3 CM consequences `corollary_3_4` and `corollary_3_7_CM` are proved; Proposition 1.6 remains the active CM endpoint.
- Section 4 is fully landed in `BEI/CIIdeals.lean` at the current paper-facing level: the single-statement bridge, specification bridge, and transferred radicality / prime decomposition / minimal-prime theorems are all proved. The minimal-prime transfer keeps the connectedness hypothesis from `corollary_3_9`.
- `OVERVIEW.md`, `NEXT_STEPS_PLAN.md`, and the public `docs/` pages should stay reader-facing; avoid turning them into internal blocker logs.

## Worker Routine

When starting fresh on a task:

1. Read the relevant paper statement in `BEI.tex`.
2. Read the live Lean declaration and nearby helper lemmas.
3. Read the matching file in `guides/` if one exists.
4. Restrict work to the requested theorem / file / branch before expanding scope.

Do not start by rewriting unrelated proofs, reorganizing files, or updating docs unless the
task actually requires that.

## Scope Discipline

- Prefer finishing one local mathematical objective over making partial edits across several branches.
- Keep theorem work, proof-engineering cleanup, and documentation cleanup separate unless they are tightly coupled.
- If a proof attempt becomes monolithic or brittle, factor it into private helper lemmas instead of continuing to patch one giant term.
- Treat scratch files and abandoned proof attempts as references, not as canonical code to preserve.

## Guides And Questions

- If a relevant guide exists in `guides/`, use it first.
- Guides should be self-contained and should preserve the original question context.
- If blocked, write a focused question in `questions/` about one exact sublemma or API issue, not a broad project-status note.
- After a question is answered in a new guide, the corresponding question file should be deleted.
- If a guide has been fully carried out and is no longer needed, the worker may delete that guide.
- When removing a completed guide, also update `guides/INDEX.md` so the guide list stays truthful.

## After Finishing A Guide

When a guide-driven task is genuinely finished, the worker should do the associated cleanup
in the same round when appropriate:

1. remove or mark complete the guide that has been fully consumed;
2. update `guides/INDEX.md`;
3. update `TODO.md` and `FORMALIZATION_MAP.md` if theorem status or file location changed;
4. update `CLAUDE.md` only if the standing workflow or file structure changed;
5. delete any answered question file from `questions/`;
6. if the resulting state is stable and truthful, commit that secured progress to git instead of leaving it only in the worktree.

Do not keep obsolete guides around if they now misrepresent the active work.

## Change Discipline

- Do not touch unrelated active branches just because they are nearby.
- Do not update status files or public docs in the middle of a proof attempt unless theorem status or file layout has actually changed.
- Before introducing a broad abstraction, check whether a smaller BEI-specific lemma is enough.
- Commit secured progress in small honest commits. Do not bundle broken proof attempts, speculative cleanup, or stale status updates into the same commit as finished work.
