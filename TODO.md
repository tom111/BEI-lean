## Current Priorities

### Priority 1: Real Cohen-Macaulay track

**HH-side global CM theorem is now fully proved (2026-04-20).**
`isCohenMacaulayRing_of_isCohenMacaulayLocalRing_at_augIdeal` closes with
axioms `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. No `sorry` remains on
the critical path inside `BEI/`.

**Monomial-side CM for `J_G` packaged (2026-04-20).**
`monomialInitialIdeal_isCohenMacaulay` in `BEI/Equidim.lean` transports
the HH CM theorem along the y-predecessor ring isomorphism, giving that
`S ⧸ monomialInitialIdeal G` is globally CM under HH conditions
(restricted to `K : Type`). This closes Step 1 of the Prop 1.6 plan.

**Paper-faithful `proposition_1_6` assembled modulo two sub-sorries (2026-04-20).**
`BEI/GroebnerDeformation.lean` lays down the full R1 framework: the
deformation ring `S[t]`, the deformation parameter, the deformed generators
`f̃_{i,j} = x_i y_j - t^(j-i) x_j y_i`, the deformation ideal `Ĩ`, the
specialization maps at `t = 0` and `t = 1`, the fiber identifications
`tildeJ_specZero_eq` (gives `monomialInitialIdeal G`) and `tildeJ_specOne_eq`
(gives `binomialEdgeIdeal G`), and the iso
`baseQuotEquiv : S ⧸ J_G ≃+* S[t] ⧸ (Ĩ ⊔ {t-1})`. The four-arrow assembly
`groebnerDeformation_cm_transfer` is a complete proof modulo two
remaining sub-sorries:

- `tildeJ_quotient_isCohenMacaulay`: global CM of `S[t] ⧸ Ĩ` (graded
  local-to-global step, via `toMathlib/GradedCM.lean` — depends on the
  dormant Case-C sorry there, which encapsulates substantial graded-depth
  infrastructure not currently in Mathlib);
- `tildeJ_tMinusOne_isSMulRegular`: `(t-1)` regular on `S[t] ⧸ Ĩ` (the
  technical heart, R1.d — flatness over `K[t]`).

`BEI/Proposition1_6.lean` now reduces to one line —
`binomialEdgeIdeal_cm_of_monomialInitialIdeal_cm := groebnerDeformation_cm_transfer hCM`.
The high-level `proposition_1_6` axiom check is
`{propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

Active follow-up work now lives in:
- `guides/work_packages/FULL_PROP_1_6_PLAN.md` — overall 3-phase plan (Phase 1 done)
- `guides/work_packages/PROP_1_6_CM_TRANSFER.md` — overall CM transfer strategy
- `guides/work_packages/GROEBNER_CM_TRANSFER.md` — the Gröbner deformation transfer (Phase 2, still open)

Completed / superseded packets are now under `guides/archive/` (see
`guides/INDEX.md`).

Supporting files on this branch:
- `BEI/PrimeDecompositionDimension.lean`
- `BEI/Equidim.lean`
- `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Defs.lean` — first real CM foundation layer: `ringDepth`, `IsCohenMacaulayLocalRing`, `IsCohenMacaulayRing`, and the basic inequality `ringDepth ≤ ringKrullDim`
- `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Basic.lean` — quotient-local-ring setup, the easy depth inequality `depth(R/xR) + 1 ≤ depth(R)`, and the converse regular-quotient CM transfer
- `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Localization.lean` — forward CM transfer, unmixedness, `CM localizes`, and the local-ring global-CM wrapper
- `toMathlib/MonomialIdeal.lean` — `Ideal.IsMonomial`, prime classification, radical-is-monomial, full primary iff characterization
- `toMathlib/SquarefreeMonomialPrimes.lean` — variable-pair ideals, vertex covers, and minimal prime ↔ minimal vertex cover
- `toMathlib/HeightVariableIdeal.lean` — quotients by variable ideals, quotient equivalences, and dimension formulas

`IsEquidim` now has a real local working definition (equidimensionality, adapted
from mathlib PR #26218) in `toMathlib/Equidim/Defs.lean`.

`prop_1_6_equidim` is now proved directly via equidimensionality (0 sorries).
The proof is in `BEI/PrimeDecompositionDimension.lean`, not the paper's Gröbner
degeneration route. It uses:
1. `closedGraph_componentCount_le_card_add_one` — convex components in closed graphs give
   `c(S) ≤ |S| + 1` (in `BEI/Equidim.lean`)
2. `corollary_3_9` — cut vertex property for minimal-prime sets
3. `closedGraph_minimalPrime_componentCount_eq` — combines 1+2 to get `c(S) = |S| + 1`
4. `isEquidim_of_equidim_minimalPrimes` + `ringKrullDim_quot_primeComponent`

The old paper-faithful route (HH bipartite graph → monomial ideal CM → transfer) is
still present as infrastructure in `BEI/Equidim.lean`. The iterated HH regularity theorem
`sum_XY_isSMulRegular_mod_diagonalSum` is now proved there, and the key CM bridge lemmas
are also done:
- `isSMulRegular_of_doubleQuot` — transfers NZD from `R ⧸ (I ⊔ J)` to `(R ⧸ I) ⧸ J.map mk_I`
- `ideal_smul_top_self` — `I • ⊤ = I` for the self-module
- `mem_map_mk_iff_mem_sup` — `mk_I(x) ∈ J.map mk_I ↔ x ∈ I ⊔ J`

The `IsWeaklyRegular` theorem `bipartiteEdgeMonomialIdeal_isWeaklyRegular` is now fully
proved (0 sorries): the diagonal elements form a weakly regular sequence on the bipartite
quotient under HH conditions.

The quotient dimension formula is now proved:
- `ringKrullDim_bipartiteEdgeMonomialIdeal`: `dim(S ⧸ I) = n + 1` under HH conditions
- Uses `ringKrullDim_quotient_radical_equidim` (radical + equidim → dim = common value)
- Supporting lemmas: `bipartiteEdgeMonomialIdeal_ne_top`, `minimalVertexCover_ncard_val`

The free variable NZD steps are now proved:
- `X_inl_last_isSMulRegular_mod_diagonalSum`: `x_{n-1}` is NZD on `S ⧸ (I ⊔ diag_{n-1})`
- `X_inr_last_isSMulRegular_mod_diagonalSum_sup`: `y_{n-1}` is NZD on `S ⧸ (I ⊔ diag_{n-1} ⊔ ⟨x_{n-1}⟩)`

The full regular sequence and local CM at the augmentation ideal are now proved:
- `bipartiteEdgeMonomialIdeal_isWeaklyRegular_full`: full weakly regular sequence of
  length `n + 1 = dim` on `S ⧸ I` (diagonal sums + two free variables)
- `isCohenMacaulayLocalRing_at_augIdeal`: `IsCohenMacaulayLocalRing` at the
  augmentation ideal (kernel of constant-coefficient map) under HH conditions

The CM-localization backport route is now complete in
`toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Localization.lean`:

- forward CM transfer is proved;
- unmixedness for CM local rings is proved;
- localization of CM local rings at primes is proved;
- and the wrapper `IsCohenMacaulayRing.of_isCohenMacaulayLocalRing` is proved.

Together with the F2 route (L1, L4, L5, L7 replacement, Session A′, Session B,
Session C1 bundled equiv, Session C2 tensor-left-localisation bridge, and
Session C3 assembly), this now closes the HH-side global CM theorem
`isCohenMacaulayRing_of_isCohenMacaulayLocalRing_at_augIdeal` (restricted to
`K : Type` because of the universe-monomorphic polynomial-away tensor API).

Both branches of the two-case split are proved:
1. the branch `p ≤ augIdeal`: closed via `isCohenMacaulayLocalRing_at_augIdeal` + CM localizes;
2. the branch `p ⊄ augIdeal`: closed via pick-U + E_U + C2 bridge + L7 tensor-away CM.

Earlier dehomogenization / graded-local-to-global route memos are preserved in
`guides/archive/`.

The Gröbner CM transfer theorem (Eisenbud 15.17) also remains unformalized, so the full
paper Cohen–Macaulay statement is still open even after the HH-side CM theorem lands.
That second paper-critical gap is now tracked separately in
`guides/work_packages/GROEBNER_CM_TRANSFER.md`.

The real CM foundation files:

1. `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Defs.lean` — definitions and the basic inequality
   `ringDepth ≤ ringKrullDim`
2. `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Basic.lean` — quotient-local-ring instances,
   `ringDepth_quotSMulTop_succ_le`,
   `isCohenMacaulayLocalRing_of_regular_quotient`,
   `isCohenMacaulayLocalRing_of_weaklyRegular_length_eq_dim` (new),
   `isCohenMacaulayLocalRing_of_ringKrullDim_eq_zero` (new)
3. `toMathlib/CohenMacaulay/Localization.lean` — Ext/Rees machinery, the hard
   depth inequality, forward CM transfer, unmixedness, localization of CM local
   rings, and the local-ring global-CM wrapper

Note: the direct proof uses the repo's local equidimensional surrogate for
Cohen–Macaulayness. This does not yet count as a full formalization of the paper's
depth-based CM statement.

### Priority 2: Section 4

Section 4 is complete in `BEI/CIIdeals.lean`. All transfers proved:
- Single-statement and specification-level bridge theorems
- Radicality (Cor 2.2), prime decomposition (Thm 3.2), minimal primes (Cor 3.9)

The minimal-prime transfer assumes a connected union graph, mirroring `corollary_3_9`.

### Background / dormant

- `toMathlib/HeightAdditivity.lean` is still incomplete, but it is not currently on the
  critical path.
- `Supplement/RauhApproach.lean` remains archived and off the main import path.
- `lake build` succeeds for the whole project; the only remaining `sorry`s are the two
  dormant ones in `toMathlib/HeightAdditivity.lean` and the two archived ones in
  `Supplement/RauhApproach.lean`.

## Maintenance Rule

Whenever a theorem is finished, moved, or split across files, update this file and
`FORMALIZATION_MAP.md` in the same round. The code is the source of truth; the docs
should follow immediately.
